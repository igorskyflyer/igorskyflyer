### 🍷 SissiS

#### WordPress and WooCommerce Solution

Developed a custom **WordPress** and **WooCommerce** solution for a luxury beverage retail. The solution handled automated orders export to a 3rd-party fulfillment provider, **FTP**-based tracking updates via **Cron**, dynamic invoice generation, tracking number fetching and customer notification. The solution was multilingual - **English**, **German**. All of the components were built from scratch and used modern **PHP** features and custom **HTTP security headers** to harden server security. Also, the client did not ask for a configuration page but one was provided to the client, to give them full control.
