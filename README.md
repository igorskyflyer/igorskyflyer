  <summary><strong>👶🏼 Early Life</strong></summary>
  <br>
  Igor was born on August 27, 1993, in Kraljevo, Serbia. From a very young age, he was a curious boy who loved discovering new things, with a gift for logic and linguistics, and notably, without going through the usual process of sounding out words letter by letter, he began reading fluently in Serbian (his native language), in both Latin and Cyrillic scripts, at the age of 5½. He was always keen on technology and everything tech-related, fascinated by how things work, analyzing and reverse engineering them, even from a very young age. His fascination with technology began with cellphones and gaming consoles. At the same time, through various video games and later TV shows (mostly crime shows), he was learning English, his first foreign language, which he continued improving through formal education. Having neither a family background in IT nor knowledge of the English language, he was left to his own devices, which further sparked his curiosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  Beyond the tech world, he has conversational proficiency in Spanish, gained through <strong>self-study</strong> and daily exposure, and a background in French from his school years, where he excelled academically. Growing up speaking <strong>Serbian</strong> gave him natural comprehension of related South Slavic languages like <strong>Croatian</strong>, <strong>Bosnian</strong>, and <strong>Montenegrin</strong>, due to their mutual intelligibility.
  <br>
  <br>
  At the end of sixth grade, around the age of 13, he began learning to code, starting with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and eventually <strong>JavaScript</strong> on a 1.5-inch screen (<em>Sony Ericsson J300i</em>) because he didn't own a computer. He spent <strong>over 8 hours a day</strong> reading and experimenting. Often, after playing outside with friends, he would pull out the phone and start building HTML pages on <em>Peperonity</em> - while they gathered around, curious and amused, watching each line take shape. Once he had mastered the basics, he created several <em>Peperonity</em> sites that became some of the platform's most popular at the time. He then dove deeper into <strong>JavaScript</strong> and built a new site on <em>XTgem</em>, which he entered into a multi-category <code>Best Website</code> contest organized by the XTgem team in 2009. His site (<em>skywap.xtgem.com</em>) <strong>won an award</strong>. Without a modern setup, Igor's curiosity and persistence became his most powerful tools.
  <br>
  <br>
  In high school (gymnasium, 4 years), Igor was an <strong>exemplary</strong> IT student, earning repeated commendations from professors. After <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, he learned <strong>PHP</strong> with <strong>WordPress</strong>, and excelled in <strong>Pascal</strong> (console apps) and <strong>Delphi</strong> (<strong><em>Object Pascal</em></strong>, GUI apps) despite not owning a computer to practise at home. He developed a strong fascination with <strong>Latin</strong> for its structure and elegance. Separately, he built a habit of translating unfamiliar math concepts into programming logic to understand them. While studying determinants, he built a solver app on his LG Cookie phone, finished the test in 20 minutes, left his professor astonished, and earned top marks and praise for ingenuity.
  <br>
  <br>
  After finishing high school, he created his next website named NeoVisio that was based on WordPress and it was the first website that brought him some money. When he saved enough, he bought his <strong>first laptop</strong> at the age of 18 and started attending the Faculty of Technical Sciences in Čačak, Serbia.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Software engineering</strong> was his main field of study, where he learned <strong>UML</strong>, <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, ethics, mathematics, marketing, psychology - among many others.
  He did both solo and team projects in his college days. While studying there, he got captivated by <strong>C#</strong> and started learning it not only in college but also through self-study at home because he is a firm believer and devotee of <strong><em>autodidacticism</em></strong>.
  <br>
  <br>
  During his studies, he <strong>gave programming classes</strong> to other, fellow students and high-school students as well and started doing <strong>freelance development</strong> which further <strong>expanded</strong> his tech stack and expertise. In his college days he was always seeking for intellectual challenges, one of them being given by one of his professors, to create a mathematical software that Igor named <a href="https://github.com/igorskyflyer/calculus-ex"><strong>CalculusEx</strong></a>, a custom-built solver for equations using the linear programming method. The mentioned professor said that nobody was able to solve it the past 5 years since he came up with it, for which Igor got a 10 (A) and was praised by the professor.
  <br>
  <br>
  Over time, Igor expanded his expertise to encompass more than 18 programming languages not as an exercise in breadth, but in building systems where these technologies interoperate with purpose. This polyglot fluency allowed him to develop cohesive, cross-platform ecosystems: from browser extensions and desktop utilities to mobile applications and command-line tools, all designed with performance and developer experience in mind.
  <br>
  <br>
  Igor began creating open-source projects primarily out of necessity - developing tools, fixes, and concepts that were not yet available. Others found these contributions beneficial. Developers began to adopt them, including some companies. Over time, he became involved in various projects beyond his own. This included bug fixes, refinements, and recommendations. It was never about receiving recognition. He firmly believed that things should function properly - and if they did not, he would ensure that they would. By solving what needed to be solved, Igor ended up building a connected ecosystem - tools, libraries, and concepts that didn't just coexist, but relied on each other. <em>What started as a necessity became a structure.</em>
