# 🏛️ Notable Projects Archive

> **Note:** This archive preserves the history of my technical evolution—from early mobile-first experiments to production-grade ecosystems. Some entries represent "Ghost Projects" where the original source code is archived or was developed under legacy constraints, but the architectural logic remains a cornerstone of my current work.
