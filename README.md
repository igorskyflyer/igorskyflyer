  <summary><strong>​🏛️ Technical Origin</strong></summary>
  <br>
  <strong>The Spark (1993-1998)</strong>
  <br>
  Igor was born on August 27, 1993, in Kraljevo, Serbia. From a very young age, he was a curious boy who loved discovering new things, with a gift for logic and linguistics. Notably, without going through the usual process of sounding out words letter by letter, he began reading fluently in Serbian in both Latin and Cyrillic scripts at the age of 5½. He was always fascinated by technology, analyzing and trying to reverse engineer cellphones and gaming consoles from a very young age. Having no family background in IT, he was left to his own devices, which only further sparked his self-directed curiosity.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Linguistic Interface (1999-2005)</strong>
  <br>
  Before writing code, Igor was decoding human languages. Through exposure to video games and TV shows (mostly crime procedurals), he taught himself <strong>English</strong>, followed by conversational proficiency in <strong>Spanish</strong> through self-study, and excelled academically in <strong>French</strong>. Growing up speaking <strong>Serbian</strong> gave him natural comprehension of related <em>South Slavic</em> languages (Croatian, Bosnian and Montenegrin). This period established his ability to recognize patterns and syntax, skills he would soon transfer to machines. Simultaneously, his creative side was also nurtured when his music professor invited him to join the school choir and later to perform as a soloist.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The First Code (2006-2007)</strong>
  <br>
  At the age of 13, he began learning to code, starting with <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> on a 1.5-inch screen (<em>Sony Ericsson J300i</em>) because he didn't own a computer. He spent <strong>over 8 hours a day</strong> reading and experimenting. Often, after playing outside with friends, he would pull out the phone and start building HTML pages on <em>Peperonity</em> - while they gathered around, curious and amused, watching each line take shape. He created several <em>Peperonity</em> sites that became some of the platform's popular sites at the time, marking his first transition from consumer to creator.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Psycho-Logic Gap (2008)</strong>
  <br>
  In gymnasium, Igor was an exemplary student in IT and languages, earning repeated commendations from professors. He developed a strong fascination with <strong>Latin</strong> for its structure and <strong>Psychology</strong> for its insight into human logic. Seeking that same clarity in other subjects, he began translating abstract mathematical concepts into programming logic; he demystified the <strong>&sum; (summation)</strong> and <strong>&prod; (product)</strong> operators by re-imagining them as <code>for</code> loops. He applied this same lens to <strong>Propositional Logic</strong>, instantly recognizing <strong>Tautologies</strong> as the mathematical equivalent of the Boolean logic he had mastered years prior.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The First Award (2009)</strong>
  <br>
  After mastering Web development basics, he built a site on <em>XTgem</em> (<code>skywap.xtgem.com</code>) which <strong>won an award</strong> in a global <code>Best Website</code> contest. Following this, he taught himself <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>WordPress</strong>. During high school, he excelled in <strong>Pascal</strong> and <strong>Delphi (Object Pascal)</strong>, despite still not owning a computer to practice at home.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The First Convergent Innovation (2010)</strong>
  <br>
  Noticing the need for a standardized JavaScript library, Igor created <strong>Nyx</strong> (named after <code>Nyx</code>, the Greek goddess of night). He built methods like <code>$()</code>, <code>.first()</code>, and <code>.ready()</code> from scratch, only later discovering that <em>jQuery</em> had independently implemented identical patterns. This was Igor's first lesson in <strong>convergent problem‑solving</strong> and <strong>original abstraction design</strong>. He used it extensively in his later projects. Without a modern setup, Igor's curiosity and persistence became his most powerful tools.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Mobile Laboratory (2011)</strong>
  <br>
  While studying determinants, Igor developed a recursive solver application on his <strong>HTC HD2</strong> using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The utility allowed him to complete a comprehensive mathematics examination in 15 minutes, significantly outperforming the allocated time, astonishing his professor in the process.
  During this period, the mobile device served as a primary engineering environment. He mastered its hardware architecture, utilized <strong>Basic4PPC</strong> to target the Windows Mobile environment, and performed low-level system modifications, including rooting and flashing over <strong>10 custom Android ROMs</strong>. These efforts were directed at exploring the boundaries of mobile kernels and hardware-software interoperability.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>A Symbolic Departure (May 2012)</strong>
  <br>
  Just before graduation, his IT professor presented him with a symbolic gift: a children's book inscribed with gratitude for his ingenuity, calling it a privilege to have had him as a student. A record of this can be found in his <a href="https://github.com/igorskyflyer/igorskyflyer/blob/main/MEMORY.md"><strong>high school memories</strong></a> page.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The First Computer (September 2012)</strong>
  <br>
  Immediately after high school, Igor built his next project, a WordPress-based site, which generated his first earnings. By the age of 19, he had saved enough to buy his <strong>first laptop</strong>, a modest, second-hand machine that finally allowed him to expand his expertise. He then enrolled in the Faculty of Technical Sciences in Čačak, Serbia. While studying <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, he treated the curriculum as a baseline; he was already learning <strong>C#</strong> through aggressive self-study long before the first lecture.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Architect in the Pocket (2013)</strong>
  <br>
  Continuing his <em>"mobile-first"</em> philosophy, Igor engineered a fully functional <strong>Content Management System</strong> (CMS) entirely on his phone. Developed using <strong>vanilla</strong> HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP, the system featured a comprehensive control panel for real-time site orchestration. It provided a robust content workflow: allowing him to create and search pages, edit their source code or templates on the fly, and manage a modular component and widget architecture. He even engineered a specialized Status Toggle to switch the site between online and offline modes instantly. This wasn't just a site; it was a portable factory built to sustain a digital presence from a 5-inch screen. Detailed records and visual evidence of this and other early works are preserved in his <a href="https://github.com/igorskyflyer/igorskyflyer/blob/main/NOTABLE_PROJECTS.md"><strong>notable projects archive</strong></a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Interop: The Performance Benchmark (March 2014)</strong>
  <br>
  ​In his <strong>Computer Architecture</strong> course, the professor offered an elite alternative to the standard theory exam: develop a functional benchmarking utility from scratch. While the majority of the cohort opted for the test, Igor chose to build.
  <br>
  ​The result was <a href="https://github.com/igorskyflyer/cs-bench-pro/"><strong>BenchPro</strong></a>. Using <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>Win32 Interop</strong>, he engineered a multi-threaded suite that utilized <strong>Monte Carlo</strong> simulations to stress-test CPU throughput. By pulling real-time <strong>WMI telemetry</strong> (L2/L3 cache, core counts), he bridged the gap between abstract architectural theory and physical silicon performance.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Unsolved: (Over)engineering the "Impossible" (November 2014)</strong>
  <br>
  By his third year, Igor was already <strong>mentoring fellow students</strong> and handling <strong>freelance development</strong>. He consistently sought challenges that exceeded standard academic boundaries; this drive culminated during his <strong>Operations Research</strong> course, where he accepted a faculty problem that had gone unsolved by <strong>~500 students</strong> for <strong>five years</strong>. With a strict <strong>two-week deadline</strong>, Igor didn't just solve the math; he architected a full desktop suite using <strong>Delphi</strong> and raw <strong>Win32 APIs</strong>. He engineered a <strong>custom GDI rendering engine</strong>, proprietary binary file formats (<code>.cxf</code>, and <code>.cxc</code>), and a system for <strong>Compromise Programming</strong>. The result, <a href="https://github.com/igorskyflyer/calculus-ex"><strong>CalculusEx</strong></a>, earned a perfect 10 (A) and finally closed the long-standing challenge.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>Logic Debugged: The Self-Validating System (2014–2015)</strong>
  <br>
  Throughout his degree, Igor maintained a "curriculum-plus" approach. While excelling in <strong>Advanced OOP</strong>, <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, and <strong>Database Programming</strong>, he consistently achieved <strong>100/100 scores</strong> on all programming-related coursework. This was so consistent that he was always exempted from final oral exams, his technical performance had already exhausted the grading scale. During this time, he continued his <strong>autonomous exploration</strong> beyond the classroom, exploring advanced software architectures and emerging tech stacks that went far beyond the classroom, effectively turning his formal education into a baseline for his personal innovation.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Vanilla Revolution: Engineering the Core (August 2015)</strong>
  <br>
  By 2015, Igor realized that off-the-shelf platforms were too <em>bloated</em> for his performance standards. He performed a total <em>"architectural purge"</em>, rebuilding his entire portal from the ground up in vanilla PHP, HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. Rather than relying on third-party plugins, he engineered a <strong>custom CMS</strong> from scratch, featuring:
  <ul data-no-restyle>
    <li><strong>Proprietary Widget System</strong>: A modular approach to sidebar content, including social integration and custom search modules.
    <li><strong>Native Traffic Analytics</strong>: A custom view-tracking engine that logged and displayed real-time engagement (e.g., <code>88 views</code>) for every post without external dependencies.
    <li><strong>Custom Comment Engine</strong>: A native, lightweight discussion system built directly into the PHP backend, including a custom CAPTCHA system.
    <li><strong>Advanced Blogging Architecture</strong>: Full CRUD functionality for posts, supporting specific categories (e.g., "music"), tags, and precise second-level timestamps.
    <li><strong>Search & Discovery Hub</strong>: An integrated search engine with a "Recent Searches" history layer that turned user queries into discoverable tags.
    <li><strong>Extreme Optimization</strong>: The system was so lean that page generation times were clocked as low as <code>0.026s</code>, proving that high-performance architecture is a product of efficient logic, not heavy hardware.
  </ul>
  Remains of it are available in his <a href="https://github.com/igorskyflyer/igorskyflyer/blob/main/NOTABLE_PROJECTS.md"><strong>public archive</strong></a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Lunar Dawn (September 2015)</strong>
  <br>
  In September 2015, Igor released <strong>Luna</strong>, a comprehensive engine designed to unify <strong>DOM orchestration, type-safe validation, and state management</strong>. Built as a high-level abstraction layer, it was his first major foray into <strong>System Design</strong>, creating a controlled environment where developers could interact with the browser through a predictable, chainable API.
  <br>
  <br>
  The documented interface showcases an early focus on <strong>Technical Scalability</strong>:
  <ul data-no-restyle>
    <li><strong>Deterministic Type Engine:</strong> A rigorous <code>.is*()</code> suite (<code>isCollection</code>, <code>isNodelist</code>) that brought structure to JavaScript’s dynamic nature.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrated UX Infrastructure:</strong> Native support for <strong>dynamic style injection</strong> (<code>addStyle</code>), <strong>AJAX</strong> (<code>luna.load</code>), and <strong>viewport effects</strong> (<code>dim</code>, <code>popup</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>URI State Management:</strong> Built-in <code>querySet</code> and <code>queryGet</code> methods, treating the URL as a primary data source for application state.</li>
  </ul>
  Remains of it are available in his <a href="https://github.com/igorskyflyer/igorskyflyer/blob/main/NOTABLE_PROJECTS.md"><strong>public archive</strong></a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>The Zero-Studio Thesis: NeoVisio Ecosystem (2016)</strong>
  <br>
  For his final academic milestone, Igor engineered a comprehensive <strong>app store and distribution platform</strong> exclusively on a smartphone. He set this as a personal <em>"stress test,"</em> choosing a programming-heavy thesis that none of his peers attempted. Despite having <strong>zero prior exposure</strong> to Java alongside the Android API, he taught himself the entire stack on the fly. Because his laptop could not support modern IDEs like the Android Studio or the Visual Studio Code, the entire ecosystem: PHP/MySQL backend, REST API, and Android client, was developed on the <strong>phone itself</strong> via a simple text editor and <em>AIDE</em>.
  <br>
  The <strong>NeoVisio Ecosystem</strong> functioned as a synchronized <strong>proprietary App Store</strong>. The client mirrored the web portal's functionality, with the addition of performing local applications scans to cross-reference versions with the server via REST, managing the full (un)installation lifecycle, and syncing <strong>user ratings and metadata</strong> in real-time. Igor engineered the client to handle <strong>network-state detection</strong>, a custom <strong>download manager</strong>, and automated <strong>homescreen shortcut injection</strong>, maintaining perfect feature parity between the browser and the native OS. The client's source code was later released to the public and is available on its official repository, <a href="https://github.com/igorskyflyer/android-neovisio-app-store"><strong>NeoVisio AppStore</strong></a>.
  <br>
  <br>
  <blockquote>
    <strong>💡 Historical Recognition</strong>
    <br>
    The platform's impact extended beyond the academic environment, eventually being indexed by global software discovery platforms as a viable third-party distribution alternative. Documentation and community-preserved snapshots of the ecosystem's public release can be found on <a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/neovisio/"><strong>AlternativeTo</strong></a> and 2 related applications lists (<a href="https://alternativeto.net/lists/9567/software-and-app-discovery/"><strong>Software and App Discovery</strong></a> and <a href="https://alternativeto.net/lists/7520/apk-sources/"><strong>APK Sources</strong></a>).

  <strong>The Interconnected Ecosystem: Open Source as Necessity (2017–Present)</strong>
  <br>
  Igor began creating open-source projects to build tools and fixes that did not yet exist. His contributions, from bug fixes to architectural refinements, have since been adopted by developers and companies globally. He believes that if a system does not function properly, it is his responsibility to ensure it does. This has resulted in a connected ecosystem of libraries and concepts that rely on one another for systemic integrity.
