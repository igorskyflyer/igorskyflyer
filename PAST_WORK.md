### üç∑ SissiS

#### WordPress and WooCommerce Solution

Developed a custom `WordPress` and `WooCommerce` solution for a luxury beverage retail. The solution handled automated orders export to a 3rd-party fulfillment provider, `FTP`-based tracking updates via `Cron`, dynamic invoice generation, tracking number fetching and customer notification. The solution was multilingual - `English`, `German`. All of the components were built from scratch and used modern `PHP` features and custom `HTTP security headers` to harden server security. Also, the client did not ask for a configuration page but one was provided to the client, to give them full control.

#### üíª Tech Stack

This solution was built from the ground up with no frameworks. The only external dependency was the `FTP` client. The stack that was used was:

- `PHP`, a language that powers `WordPress`, `WooCommerce` and all custom plugin logic. `WordPress` is the `CMS` with tailored post types and admin tools
- `WooCommerce` was chosen as the e-commerce engine, extended with client-requested features
- `Custom order workflow plugin` - built for export, tracking, invoicing, and automation, using the following `data formats`: `CSV`, `XML`, and `JSON` for 3rd-party integrations
- `Security` was increased with custom `HTTP` headers and other security measures
- `Multilingual support` was a client's need, native English and German was implemented, with no external translation plugins
- `Admin UX` was enhanced by implementing dynamic interactions via `AJAX`
- `Email marketing` powered by `KlickTipp` (email marketing platform) was integrated in order to increase customer `conversions`
- `Shared logic` - reusable helpers for `FTP`, `email`, `caching`, `debugging`, and `scheduling` were used for performance and non-repeating code.

#### üîß Backend

- `Setup` - setup configuration of `WordPress` and `WooCommerce` with a custom database schema
- `Plugin` for order export in `XML` and `JSON` formats was built to match the client's needs
- `CSV` import/export pipelines with validation, tracking, and result logging were built for migration of previous customers on the legacy website
- Dynamic invoice generation with editable templates
- `PayPal` integration, and footer customization were created, per client needs
- `Meta-boxes` were implemented for custom post metadata and admin-side editing
- Reusable helpers for `FTP`, `AJAX`, `email`, `caching`, and `debugging` were used to avoid code-bloat and ensure atomic functioning
- `Cron` was used as a `scheduler` for `automated` tasks and background operations, orders `import`/`export`, `CSV` importing and parsing
- `Secure HTTP headers` and custom `security` logic was implemented to mitigate security attacks.

##### üöö Fulfillment & Tracking Integration

- `WooCommerce` orders are exported to a 3rd-party fulfillment provider via automated `XML` feed
- Periodically connect to the provider's `FTP` server to retrieve shipped order data via a `Cron` task
- Parse incoming `CSV` files to extract `tracking numbers` and deduct carrier info from the tracking numbers
- Update `WooCommerce` orders with tracking numbers and carrier-specific tracking `URLs`
- Display `tracking info` in the admin dashboard for staff visibility
- Send automated emails to customers with personalized tracking links based on carrier
